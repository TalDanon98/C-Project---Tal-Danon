# C-Project---Tal-Danon
The project receives several assembly language files, uncovers a large variety of errors, and converts them into three machine language files.


The project made by Tal Danon & Shon Salomonovitch.  
We created a presentation file that simplifies the work process of the project.  
In addition, we created a folder 'tester' that include a few error examples files with the screenshot of the results
and the file from the course booklet.
